   Red Velvet revisited their "velvet" image by releasing their second full-length album
    Perfect Velvet on November 17 with the lead single "Peek-a-Boo".[62] Critics opined that
     the group finally managed to make that side of their concept and music appeal more to the
     public and unlike their first "velvet" release, the album and single were both commercially
     successful.[63] It peaked atop Billboard's World Album Chart which once again set the record
      for most number-ones on the chart by a K-pop girl group but also tied with most number-ones among all K-pop acts.
   "Peek-a-Boo" peaked at #2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, tying with their
   2016 single "Russian Roulette".[64] In South Korea, the album and the single "Peek-a-Boo"
    both charted at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart.[65][66] Through the release of Rookie,
   The Red Summer and Perfect Velvet all in the same year, along with the popularity of the single
    "Red Flavor" which according to Jung Ji-won of Osen best represents the year of 2017,
     and the success of their albums overseas, Red Velvet achieved a 'top girl group'
     status in South Korea, which was cemented further when Perfect Velvet sold over
     100,000 copies and "Peek-A-Boo" won on the music program Inkigayo on their
     last day of promotions for the song, proving its longevity on the charts.
